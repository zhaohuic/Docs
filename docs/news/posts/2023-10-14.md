# Wulver Maintenance

!!! warning "GPFS Fileset Changes"   
    
    Wulver will be out of service Wed Oct 18th between 9:00 am-11:00 am for updates and configuration changes. The maintence will be conducted to fix the `stale file handle` error on `/scratch` while accessing files from login node.
    
    # Maintencance Plans
    
    ## Recommendation:

    * Each fileset gets it’s own inode namespace
    * Fileset names to automatically inherit pool policies
    * Additional fileset settings for chmod to not conflict with ACLs

    ## Migration Plan:

    * Create new filesets and link under /mmfs1/Scratch and /mmfs1/Project
        * New fileset names with sata1-project_xx and nvme1-scratch_xx (no bearing on FS path)
        * New fileset have own inode spaces
    * Rsync data from old to new location
    * Job outage for final copy and change
    * Final rsyncs
        * Remove symlink for /mmfs1/scratch and create /mmfs1/scratch
        * Unlink/relink filesets in new location
        * Resolve any links remaining on nodes/images
