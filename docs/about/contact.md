Requests for assistance with HPC resources have been integrated into the campus-wide ServiceNow system. To have a service ticket created automatically and assigned to the HPC staff, email [hpc@njit.edu](mailto:hpc@njit.edu). Before requesting assistance, we encourage you to take a look at the relevant documentation on this site. 

For prompt response, please consider the following when submitting a ticket. 

- Email Subject
    - Very short summary of the issue as a subject, examples:
        - Lochness: Unable to submit jobs to public partition
        - Lochness: Job error - no space on disk
        - Lochness: Jobs are getting killed

 - Email Content
     - **JOB NUMBER**
     - System, Software and Partition where you are having an issue.
     - Detailed description of your issue including modules loaded, and location of input, output and error files.
     - If you have an error to report, paste the error message. Do not take a snapshot and upload the image.
     - An image is not helpful when a long string of characters including directory path or file names needs to be copied.
     - Anything else that you think may be necessary for us to understand and find a resolution to your issue.

- Software requests
     - Submit a request for [HPC Software Installation](https://njit.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0746c1f31b6691d04c82cddf034bcbe2&sysparm_category=405f99b41b5b1d507241400abc4bcb6b) by visiting the [Service Catalog](https://njit.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_category) 
     - **Note**: Users should consider installing software in their home directory especially Python and R packages. See [Building your own](conda.md) for instructions on using conda or mamba. If you encounter issues, consider asking for help above rather than requesting a software install.
     - You will need to enter the following information
           - Name of software and URL to download.
           - If software is behind a paywall or account, please download the software, copy it over to lochness and provide location from where we can copy it for installation.

- Account requests
     - Requests for an account must come from faculty advisors by sending an email to [hpc@njit.edu](mailto:hpc@njit.edu) including the UCIDs for the accounts to be created.
     - Students making requests should add their faculty advisor to the request. Requests will only be approved after confirmation by faculty advisor.
     - To use HPC in courses, the course instructor should submit a request and include UCID's for the accounts to be created.
     - Guest Accounts: Faculty can use [Service Now](https://njit.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=3b5796001b9b59507241400abc4bcb80&sysparm_category=405f99b41b5b1d507241400abc4bcb6b) to request Guest Access on *HPC resources only* for their external collaborators for a period of 1 year (can be renewed annually).
