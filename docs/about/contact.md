     - Anything else that you think may be necessary for us to understand and find a resolution to your issue.

- Software requests
     - Submit a request for [HPC Software Installation](https://njit.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0746c1f31b6691d04c82cddf034bcbe2&sysparm_category=405f99b41b5b1d507241400abc4bcb6b) by visiting the [Service Catalog](https://njit.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_category) 
     - **Note**: Users should consider installing software in their home directory especially Python and R packages. See [Building your own](../../Softwares/python/conda/) for instructions on using conda or mamba. If you encounter issues, consider asking for help above rather than requesting a software install.
