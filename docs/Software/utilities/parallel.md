title: GNU Parallel
---

[GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that reads from a pipe. GNU parallel can then split the input and pipe it into commands in parallel.

!!! tip
     You can use GNU Parallel on your Mac OSX laptop/desktop to run applications in parallel. Just install using either brew or Macports

     ```console
     sudo port install parallel
     brew install parallel
     ```


## Availability

```python exec="on"
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('docs/assets/tables/module.csv')
soft = df.query('Software == "parallel"')
print(soft.to_markdown(index=False))
```


## Usage

???+ example "Usage"

    ```console
    module load parallel/20200422
    parallel echo ::: 1 2 3 ::: 4 5 6
    ```

## Purpose

GNU Parallel is a tool for running a series of jobs, mostly serial jobs, in parallel. This tool is best suited for running a bunch of serial jobs that may not run for the same simulation time. For example, the most easiest way to run a series of serial jobs in parallel on __n cpus__ within one submit script is as follows

```bash
./job_1 &
./job_2 &
...
./job_n &
wait
./job_(n+1) &
./job_(n+2) &
...
./job_2n &
wait
./job_(2n+1) &
./job_(2n+2) &
...
./job_3n &
wait
```

This works most efficiently when all jobs have the same or almost the same run time. If run times for jobs are unequal, then __n__ jobs are run simultaneously and the cpus remain idle until all __n__ jobs are completed before looping through the next __n__ jobs. This will lead to idle time and inefficient consumption of cpu time.

GNU Parallel solves this issue by first launching __n__ jobs. When one job completes, then the next job in sequence is started. This permits efficient use of cpu time by reducing the wait time and letting a number of small jobs to run while some cpus work on longer jobs.

```bash
parallel job_{1} ::: $(seq 1 3n)
```
