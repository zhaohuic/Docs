* Scheduling
    * The SLURM scheduler uses a “fair share” algorithm to assign priority to jobs. The “fair share” algorithm takes into account factors such as user history, wall time request, etc … to assign priority. The “fair share” algorithm is configure to favor smaller jobs. 
    * Limits
        * Wall time: 30 Days. Note that shorter wall time receive higher priority.
	* Cores/RAM: No limit but we request users be considerate. There are limited resources for public access.
